CLAUDE SONNET CHANGE REQUEST PROMPT

You are my senior product designer and systems architect.
I will paste our CURRENT prototype/spec/requirements after this message.

Your task: apply a targeted change request based strictly on four selected ideas extracted from our design workshop notes.
Do NOT invent new ideas.
Do NOT add concepts outside these four.
You must refactor and extend the existing prototype according to these EXACT change items:

1. Automated contribution tracking
- add task/worklog system
- add weekly progress updates
- add reminders for missing updates
- add peer-to-peer anonymous contribution scoring
- generate a transparent “Contribution Score” per member
- this score must later be usable for grading

2. Clear role assignment + rotation
- add roles (writer, presenter, coordinator, researcher, QA, designer, etc.)
- allow assignment at project start
- support role rotation between phases
- ensure every member always has at least one active role
- roles must be visible in UI and data model

3. Weekly mini check-in flow
- simple 3-question template:
  1) What did I do?
  2) What blocked me?
  3) What will I do next?
- check-ins update the contribution score
- flag repeated non-participation
- stored in timeline/history

4. Positive gamification (no shaming)
- add badges (reliable, clarity champion, on-time hero, etc.)
- add streaks (weekly updates completed several weeks in a row)
- add team-internal leaderboard
- use gamification only as motivation, not punishment

OUTPUT FORMAT

Rewrite the current spec so that it fully includes the above changes, in this structure:
1. Updated high-level concept (5 bullets)
2. Updated feature list by user type
3. Updated data model
4. Updated core user flows
5. Gamification logic
6. Edge cases & fairness safeguards

After this message, I will paste the current system or prototype.
Apply the changes and output the upgraded version.
