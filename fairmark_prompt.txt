You are a senior full-stack engineer.  
Help me build a **Next.js 14 (App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind)** prototype that solves the university groupwork fairness problem:

> Some students contribute significantly more, everyone gets the same grade → unfairness → demotivation.

This prototype must be **frontend-only**, storing all data in **localStorage**.

# 🧩 FEATURES & REQUIREMENTS

## 1) User identification (simple)
No authentication.  
Just:

### `/login`
- Ask for **first name**
- Save into `localStorage.currentUserName`
- Redirect to `/groups`

Load user automatically on other pages.

---

## 2) Group creation **and** joining  
Users can either:

### **A) Create a new group**
Page: `/groups/new`

Ask for:
- **Group / project name**
- Optional description

Create:
- `groupId = crypto.randomUUID()`
- Initial group object stored under `localStorage.fairGroupworkGroups`

Group structure:

```ts
type Member = {
  id: string
  name: string
  hours: number
  tasks: number
}

type Group = {
  id: string
  name: string
  description?: string
  members: Member[]
  totalTasksNeeded: number
}
```

Add **current user automatically** into the group as the first member.

After creation → redirect to `/group/{id}`.

---

### **B) Join an existing group**
Page: `/groups/join`

Options:

1. User enters **group ID** manually  
   → Validate existence  
   → Add user into the group  
   → Redirect to `/group/{id}`

2. Show list of all groups stored in localStorage  
   → Clicking joins immediately  
   → Redirect

This is prototype-level, no auth needed — anyone can join any group.

---

## 3) Main dashboard: `/group/[id]`

Dashboard shows:

### **1. Greeting**
“Hi {currentUserName}, welcome to {groupName}”

### **2. Overall progress bar**
Formula:

```
totalLoggedTasks = sum(member.tasks)
progress = totalLoggedTasks / totalTasksNeeded * 100
```

Show a big Tailwind progress bar.

### **3. Contribution table**
Columns:
- Member
- Hours
- Tasks
- Contribution %  
Formula:

```
score = hours + tasks * 0.5
percent = score / sum(scores) * 100
```

### **4. Fairness / alignment badge**
Rules:

- If one member > 50% → red badge “Unbalanced”
- If top two > 80% → yellow badge “Slightly unbalanced”
- Else → green badge “Balanced”

### **5. Buttons**
- Add work → `/group/[id]/contribute`
- Add member → `/group/[id]/add-member`
- Change project settings → `/group/[id]/settings`
- Back to group list → `/groups`

---

## 4) Log contribution page: `/group/[id]/contribute`

Form fields:

- Select **member** (dropdown)
- Hours worked (number)
- Tasks completed (number)

On submit:
- Update localStorage group state
- Redirect to dashboard

---

## 5) Add member page: `/group/[id]/add-member`

Very simple form:
- Name
- Add → pushes into group.members[]

---

## 6) Pages required

Claude must generate complete runnable code for:

### Required pages
- `app/layout.tsx`
- `app/login/page.tsx`
- `app/groups/page.tsx` (list + join options)
- `app/groups/new/page.tsx` (create group)
- `app/groups/join/page.tsx` (join by ID + list)
- `app/group/[id]/page.tsx` (dashboard)
- `app/group/[id]/contribute/page.tsx`
- `app/group/[id]/add-member/page.tsx`
- `app/group/[id]/settings/page.tsx`

### Required components
- `components/ProgressBar.tsx`
- `components/ContributionTable.tsx`
- `components/FairnessBadge.tsx`
- `components/GroupCard.tsx`

### Required context
- `context/GroupContext.tsx`
Handles loading/saving all groups to localStorage.

---

## 7) UX Rules
- Mobile-first
- Tailwind:
  - container: `max-w-xl mx-auto p-4`
  - buttons: `bg-blue-600 text-white rounded px-4 py-2`
  - card: `rounded-lg border p-4 shadow-sm`

---

## 8) Output Format
The answer must:

- Include full code for every file
- No placeholders, no ellipses
- Fully runnable after `npx create-next-app@latest --ts --tailwind`
- Include a brief explanation of localStorage state lifecycle

---

If anything is unclear, make a reasonable assumption.
